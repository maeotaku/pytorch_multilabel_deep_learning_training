# pytorch_multilabel_deep_learning_training
Code to train a deep learning model with a multilabel dataset using PyTorch. It has been refactored from examples from PyTorch official examples.

The multilabel dataset code comes from my own other repo:
https://github.com/maeotaku/pytorch_multilabel_dataset

Please not the utils module comes from: https://github.com/bearpaw/pytorch-classification/tree/master/utils

A multilabel dataset contains several labels per item/image. This code allows to train a PyTorch model using this idea.
